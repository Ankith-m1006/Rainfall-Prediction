## Introduction

Rainfall prediction is crucial for agriculture, water resource management, and disaster prevention. This project aims to build a predictive model to forecast rainfall based on historical weather data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Dataset Source](#). It contains historical weather data, including features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and previous rainfall.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rainfall-prediction.git
cd rainfall-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the raw data.
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. **Model Training:** Train the predictive model on the processed data.
   ```bash
   python src/model_training.py
   ```

3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the trained model.
   ```bash
   python src/model_evaluation.py
   ```

## Modeling Process

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the dataset, identify trends, and visualize data.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize/scale features.
3. **Model Building:** Train various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LSTM, ARIMA) and select the best-performing model.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

## Results

The final model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of X mm and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of Y mm. Detailed evaluation results and model performance metrics are available in the `notebooks/Modeling.ipynb` notebook.
